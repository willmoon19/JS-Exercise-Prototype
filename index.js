  /* 
    TASK 4
      In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:

    1.New
      When new is used while calling a function, uses that function to create a new object where "this" references the new object

    2. Apply, Call, and Bind
      These are used in order to pass an object as an argument through "this", through another object's function 

    3. Function called as a method
      Think of "this" as a variable, that we are passing an object through. When you have "this.name" it is equal to "obj.name"

    4. Free function invocation
      When a function is in the global scope and "this" has nothing to reference it will default to the window object? window?
